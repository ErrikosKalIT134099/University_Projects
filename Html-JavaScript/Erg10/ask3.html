He reportedly <a href="/wiki/Defamation" title="Defamation">libeled</a> some student on his radio show; the kid's family tried to sue my father.

He stayed and he graduated."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Reed graduated with honors from Syracuse University's <a href="/wiki/Syracuse_University_College_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences">College of Arts and Sciences</a> with a B.A. in <a href="/wiki/English_studies" title="English studies">English</a> in June 1964.<sup id="cite_ref-Salon.com_LouReed_Syracuse_BA_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Salon.com_LouReed_Syracuse_BA-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
		<p>While enrolled at Syracuse University, he studied under poet <a href="/wiki/Delmore_Schwartz" title="Delmore Schwartz">Delmore Schwartz</a>, who he said was "the first great person I ever met", and they became friends. He credited Schwartz with showing him how "with the simplest language imaginable, and very short, you can accomplish the most astonishing heights."<sup id="cite_ref-documentary_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-documentary-24">[24]</a></sup> One of Reed's fellow students at Syracuse in the early 60's (who also studied under Schwartz) was the musician <a href="/wiki/Garland_Jeffreys" title="Garland Jeffreys">Garland Jeffreys</a>; they remained close friends until the end of Reed's life.<sup id="cite_ref-syracuse.com_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-syracuse.com-25">[25]</a></sup> Jeffreys once offered the following recollection of Schwartz and Reed during Reed's time at Syracuse: "At four in the afternoon we'd all meet at [the bar] <i>The Orange Grove</i>. Me, Delmore and Lou. That would often be the center of the crew. And Delmore was the leader - our quiet leader." <sup id="cite_ref-syracuse.com_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-syracuse.com-25">[25]</a></sup> While at Syracuse, Reed was also introduced to <a href="/wiki/Heroin" title="Heroin">heroin</a> for the first time.

Jaw gave me hepatitis immediately, which is pathetic and laughable at once."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> While at Syracuse, Reed also met fellow guitar-playing student <a href="/wiki/Sterling_Morrison" title="Sterling Morrison">Sterling Morrison</a>, who would later play with Reed in <a href="/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground" title="The Velvet Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>. While Morrison wasn't attending Syracuse at the time, he made Reed's acquaintance while he was visiting mutual friend Jim Tucker, the older brother of Velvet Underground drummer <a href="/wiki/Maureen_Tucker" title="Maureen Tucker">Maureen Tucker</a> who happened to be attending school there. Reed would later dedicate the song "<a href="/wiki/European_Son" title="European Son">European Son</a>", from the Velvet Underground's debut album, to his teacher Delmore Schwartz.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> In 1982, Reed also recorded "My House" from his early 80's album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Blue_Mask" title="The Blue Mask">The Blue Mask</a></i> as a tribute to his late mentor. He later said that his goals as a writer were "to bring the sensitivities of the novel to rock music" or to write <a href="/wiki/The_Great_American_Novel" title="The Great American Novel" class="mw-redirect">the Great American Novel</a> in a record album.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></p>

		<p>In 1964, Reed moved to New York City and began working as an in-house songwriter for <a href="/wiki/Pickwick_Records" title="Pickwick Records">Pickwick Records</a>. In 1964, he wrote and recorded the single "The Ostrich", a parody of popular <a href="/wiki/Dance_music" title="Dance music">dance songs</a> of the time, which included lines such as "put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it". His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and arranged for a band to be assembled around Reed to promote the recording. The ad hoc group, called "The Primitives", included Welsh musician <a href="/wiki/John_Cale" title="John Cale">John Cale</a>, who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer <a href="/wiki/La_Monte_Young" title="La Monte Young">La Monte Young</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Theatre_of_Eternal_Music" title="Theatre of Eternal Music">Theatre of Eternal Music</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Tony_Conrad" title="Tony Conrad">Tony Conrad</a>. Cale and Conrad were both surprised to find that for "The Ostrich", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his "<a href="/wiki/Ostrich_guitar" title="Ostrich guitar">ostrich guitar</a>" tuning. This technique created a <a href="/wiki/Drone_(music)" title="Drone (music)">drone</a> effect similar to their experimentation in Young's <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" title="Avant-garde">avant-garde</a> ensemble. Disappointed with Reed's performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed's early repertoire (including "<a href="/wiki/Heroin_(The_Velvet_Underground_song)" title="Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)">Heroin</a>"), and a partnership began to evolve.<sup id="cite_ref-documentary_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-documentary-24">[24]</a></sup></p>
		<p>Reed and Cale (who would play viola, keyboards and bass) lived together on the <a href="/wiki/Lower_East_Side" title="Lower East Side">Lower East Side</a>, and invited Reed's college acquaintance guitarist <a href="/wiki/Sterling_Morrison" title="Sterling Morrison">Sterling Morrison</a> and Cale's neighbour drummer <a href="/wiki/Angus_MacLise" title="Angus MacLise">Angus MacLise</a> to join the group, thus forming <a href="/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground" title="The Velvet Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>. When the opportunity came to play their first paying gig at <a href="/wiki/Summit_High_School_(New_Jersey)" title="Summit High School (New Jersey)">Summit High School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Summit,_New_Jersey" title="Summit, New Jersey">Summit, New Jersey</a>, MacLise quit because he believed that accepting money for art was a <a href="/wiki/Selling_out" title="Selling out">sellout</a> and also did not want to participate in a structured gig. He was replaced on drums by <a href="/wiki/Maureen_Tucker" title="Maureen Tucker">Maureen Tucker</a>, initially for that one show, but she soon became a full-time member with her pounding style of drumming an integral part of the band's distinctive sound, despite the initial objections of Cale. Though internally unstable (Cale left in 1968, Reed in 1970), and without commercial success, the band has a long-standing reputation as one of the most influential in rock history.<sup id="cite_ref-nrr-loc_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nrr-loc-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-rrhallbio_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rrhallbio-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dann_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dann-31">[31]</a></sup></p>
		<p>The group soon caught the attention of artist <a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. One of Warhol's first contributions was to integrate them into the <a href="/wiki/Exploding_Plastic_Inevitable" title="Exploding Plastic Inevitable">Exploding Plastic Inevitable</a>. Warhol's associates inspired many of Reed's songs as he fell into a thriving, multifaceted artistic scene.<sup id="cite_ref-reedbook_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-reedbook-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-thompson18_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-thompson18-34">[34]</a></sup> Reed rarely gave an interview without paying homage to Warhol as a mentor. Conflict emerged when Warhol had the idea for the group to take on a <a href="/wiki/Chanteuse" title="Chanteuse" class="mw-redirect">chanteuse</a>, the European former model and singer <a href="/wiki/Nico" title="Nico">Nico</a>. Despite his initial resistance, Reed wrote several songs for Nico to sing, and the two were briefly lovers.<sup id="cite_ref-bockris_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bockris-35">[35]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_%26_Nico" title="The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico">The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</a></i> reached No. 171 on the charts.<sup id="cite_ref-rrhallbio_30-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rrhallbio-30">[30]</a></sup></p>
		<p>The album is now widely considered one of the most influential rock albums ever recorded. <i>Rolling Stone</i> has it listed as the 13th greatest album of all time. <a href="/wiki/Brian_Eno" title="Brian Eno">Brian Eno</a> once famously stated that although few people bought the album, most of those who did were inspired to form their own band.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Havel" title="Václav Havel">Václav Havel</a> credited this album, which he bought while visiting the U.S., with inspiring him to become president of Czechoslovakia.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
		<p>By the time the band recorded <i><a href="/wiki/White_Light/White_Heat" title="White Light/White Heat">White Light/White Heat</a></i>, Nico had quit and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale's wishes. Warhol's replacement as manager was <a href="/wiki/Steve_Sesnick" title="Steve Sesnick">Steve Sesnick</a>. In 1968, Cale left the band at Reed's behest.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed's tactics but continued with the group. Cale's replacement was Boston-based musician <a href="/wiki/Doug_Yule" title="Doug Yule">Doug Yule</a>, who played bass, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> The group now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more as a vehicle for Reed to develop his songwriting craft.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> The group released two albums with this lineup: 1969's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_(album)" title="The Velvet Underground (album)">The Velvet Underground</a></i> and 1970's <i><a href="/wiki/Loaded_(The_Velvet_Underground_album)" title="Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)">Loaded</a></i>. The latter included two of the group's most commercially successful songs, "Rock and Roll" and "<a href="/wiki/Sweet_Jane" title="Sweet Jane">Sweet Jane</a>".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="when were they commercially successful (April 2015)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> After the band's move to <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Records" title="Atlantic Records">Atlantic Records</a>' <a href="/wiki/Cotillion_Records" title="Cotillion Records">Cotillion</a> label, their new manager pushed Reed to change the subject matter of his songs to lighter topics in hopes of commercial success. <i>Loaded</i> had taken more time to record than the previous three albums together, but had not broken them through to a wider audience.</p>

		<p>Reed's breakthrough album, <i><a title="Transformer (album)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28album%29">Transformer</a></i>, was released in November 1972. <i>Transformer</i> was co-produced by <a title="David Bowie" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie">David Bowie</a> and <a title="Mick Ronson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Ronson">Mick Ronson</a>, and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The hit single "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Walk on the Wild Side (Reed)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_on_the_Wild_Side_%28Reed%29">Walk on the Wild Side</a>" was an ironic yet affectionate salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol. When first introduced to Reed's music, Bowie had said, "I had never heard anything quite like it. It was a revelation to me."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-interview_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-interview-46">[46]</a></sup></p>
		<p>Each of the song's five verses poignantly describes a person who had been a fixture at <a title="The Factory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory">The Factory</a> during the mid-to-late 1960s: (1) <a title="Holly Woodlawn" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Woodlawn">Holly Woodlawn</a>, (2) <a title="Candy Darling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Darling">Candy Darling</a>, (3) <a title="Joe Dallesandro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Dallesandro">"Little Joe" Dallesandro</a>, (4) "Sugar Plum Fairy" Joe Campbell and (5) <a title="Jackie Curtis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Curtis">Jackie Curtis</a>. The song's transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist <a title="Herbie Flowers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Flowers">Herbie Flowers</a> and saxophonist <a title="Ronnie Ross" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Ross">Ronnie Ross</a>) was musically somewhat atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of <a title="Nelson Algren" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Algren">Nelson Algren</a>'s novel of the same name, though the play failed to materialize.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-reedbook42_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-reedbook42-48">[48]</a></sup> Ronson's arrangements brought out new aspects of Reed's songs. "<a title="Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Day_%28Lou_Reed_song%29">Perfect Day</a>," for example, features delicate strings and soaring dynamics. It was rediscovered in the 1990s and allowed Reed to drop "Walk on the Wild Side" from his concerts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup></p>
		<p><i>Transformer</i> was Reed's commercial and critical pinnacle, and he resented the shadow the record cast over the rest of his career. An argument between Bowie and Reed ended their working relationship for several years, though its subject is not known. (The two reconciled some years later, and Reed performed with Bowie at the latter's 50th birthday concert at <a title="Madison Square Garden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in 1997.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> They did not formally collaborate again until 2003's <i><a title="The Raven (Lou Reed album)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven_%28Lou_Reed_album%29">The Raven</a>.</i>) Touring in support of <i>Transformer</i> posed the challenge of forming a band for the first time since joining the Velvets. Reed hired an inexperienced bar band, the Tots, and spent much of 1972 and early 1973 on the road with them. Though they improved over the months, criticism of their still-basic abilities ultimately led Reed to fire them mid-tour. He chose keyboardist <a title="Moogy Klingman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moogy_Klingman">Moogy Klingman</a> to come up with a new five-member backing band on barely a week's notice. Thus the tour continued with a denser, bluesier and tighter sound that presaged the very successful live albums Reed would record with all different musicians in December.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup></p>
		<p>Reed followed <i>Transformer</i> with the darker <i><a title="Berlin (Lou Reed album)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_%28Lou_Reed_album%29">Berlin</a></i>. <i>Berlin</i> is a <a title="Concept album" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album">concept album</a> about two junkies in love in the city. The songs variously concern <a class="mw-redirect" title="Domestic abuse" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_abuse">domestic abuse</a> ("Caroline Says I," "Caroline Says II"), drug addiction ("How Do You Think It Feels"), adultery and prostitution ("The Kids"), and suicide ("The Bed"). Reed's late-1973 European tour, featuring dual lead guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, mixed his <i>Berlin</i> material with older numbers. Response to <i>Berlin</i> at the time of its release was decidedly negative, with <i>Rolling Stone</i> pronouncing it "a disaster".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Since then the album has been critically reevaluated, and in 2003 <i>Rolling Stone</i> included it in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup></p>
		<p>After <i>Berlin</i> came two albums in 1974, <i><a title="Sally Can't Dance" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Can%27t_Dance">Sally Can't Dance</a></i>, and a live record <i><a title="Rock 'n' Roll Animal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Animal">Rock 'n' Roll Animal</a></i>; the latter contained performances of the Velvet Underground songs "Sweet Jane" and "Heroin" and would go on to become his biggest selling album. <i>Rock 'n' Roll Animal</i>, and its follow-up released in early 1975 <i>Lou Reed Live</i>, primarily featuring live <i>Transformer</i> material, were both recorded at the same show (Academy Of Music, NYC December 21, 1973), and kept Reed in the public eye with strong sales. (The later expanded CD version of <i>Rock 'n' Roll Animal</i> taken together with <i>Lou Reed Live</i> are the entirety of the show that night, although not in the running order it was performed.)</p>
		<div class="quotebox"><div class=""><p>"Lou Reed doesn't just write about squalid characters, he allows them to leer and breathe in their own voices, and he colors familiar landscapes through their own eyes. In the process, Reed has created a body of music that comes as close to disclosing the parameters of human loss and recovery as we're likely to find. That qualifies him, in my opinion, as one of the few real heroes rock &amp; roll has raised."</p></div><cite>—Mikal Gilmore, <i>Rolling Stone,</i> (1979)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Gilmore_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Gilmore-54">[54]</a></sup></cite></div>
		<p>As he had done with <i>Berlin</i> after <i>Transformer</i>, in 1975 Reed responded to commercial success with a commercial failure, a double album of electronically generated audio feedback, <i><a title="Metal Machine Music" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music">Metal Machine Music</a></i>. Critics interpreted it as a gesture of contempt, an attempt to break his contract with RCA or to alienate his less sophisticated fans. Reed claimed that the album was a genuine artistic effort, even suggesting that quotations of classical music could be found buried in the feedback. Lester Bangs declared it "genius", though also psychologically disturbing. The album was reportedly returned to stores by the thousands after a few weeks.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Though later admitting that the liner notes' list of instruments is fictitious and intended as parody, Reed continued to maintain that <i>MMM</i> was a serious album; though at the time he had taken it seriously, he was also "very stoned".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In the 2000s it was adapted for orchestral performance by the German ensemble <a title="Ulrich Krieger" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_Krieger">Zeitkratzer</a>.</p>
		<p>By contrast, 1975's <i><a title="Coney Island Baby" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Baby">Coney Island Baby</a></i> was mainly a warm and mellow album, though for its characters Reed still drew on the underbelly of city life. At this time his lover was a <a title="Transgender" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender">transgender</a> woman, Rachel, mentioned in the dedication of "Coney Island Baby" and appearing in the photos on the cover of Reed's 1977 "best of" album, <i><a title="Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_on_the_Wild_Side:_The_Best_of_Lou_Reed">Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed</a></i>. While <i><a title="Rock and Roll Heart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Heart">Rock and Roll Heart</a></i>, his 1976 debut for his new record label <a title="Arista Records" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Records">Arista</a>, fell short of expectations, <i><a title="Street Hassle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Hassle">Street Hassle</a></i> (1978) was a return to form in the midst of the punk scene he had helped to inspire. Reed was dismissive of punk, and rejected any affiliation with it. "I'm too literate to be into punk rock . . . The whole <a title="CBGB" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB">CBGB</a>'s, new <a title="Max's Kansas City" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max%27s_Kansas_City">Max's</a> thing that everyone's into and what's going on in London—you don't seriously think I'm responsible for what's mostly rubbish?"<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup></p>
